Tips for running everything.

Localstack
To setup localstack, follow the instructions below
    https://github.com/localstack/localstack

A great way to set this up is using a searate python virtualenv with python 3.6
Included in here is a source_locastack.sh file. This has all the environment variables
necessary to run a simple localstack setup.

Once localstack is running with `localstack start` (assuming the source_locastack file is sourced),
just run the setup.sh file. This file might need to be run each time you start localstack.


Next, run `node consumer.js`. This uses sqs-consumer to listen for records.

To test you can run the following

```
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4572 s3 cp test_file.txt s3://greenstand-bucket
```

This assumes you have a test_file.txt. That will print the message from the consumer.
